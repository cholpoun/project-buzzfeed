    <p>Dinosaurs roamed the planet during the Mesozoic Era, which is divided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic, and
        Cretaceous. They were the dominant terrestrial animals for an incredibly long span of time, from about 230
        million to 66 million years ago.</p>

    <h2>They Came in All Shapes and Sizes</h2>
    <p> Dinosaurs ranged from the size of a chicken, like the Compsognathus, to the massive Argentinosaurus, which could
        reach up to 100 feet in length and weigh around 100 tons. This diversity in size allowed them to occupy various
        ecological niches</p>
