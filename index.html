                <p>Dinosaurs roamed the Earth for over 160 million years, and their reign began about 230 million years
                    ago.
                    The T-Rex was one of the largest meat-eating dinosaurs, standing up to 40 feet tall.</p>

                <p> Dinosaurs ranged from the size of a chicken, like the Compsognathus, to the massive
                    Argentinosaurus,which could reach up to 100 feet in length and weigh around 100 tons. This diversity
                    in
                    ssize allowed them to occupy various ecological niches.</p>

                <p> Scientific research has shown that birds are actually the direct descendants of theropod dinosaurs,
                    like
                    the Velociraptor. This means that dinosaurs are not entirely extinctâ€”rather, they live on as birds

                    feathers. These feathers might have been used for insulation, display, or even primitive forms of
                    flights</p>
